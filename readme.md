# What is Spicetify?
It's a Spotify modification which enhances your overall experience with Spotify, letting you install custom themes, extensions and even apps within Spotify. So if you want uninterrupted listening, that's viable.

# Installation
It's relatively easy and simple, just download the latest release (from this repository) and unzip it, then run Spicetify and it'll handle everything for you.

# Why was this installer made?
The installer was made purely for convenience sake. Some people don't like terminals or fear the use of terminals which is completely valid, others just want the convenience of not having to use terminals or run scripts, this installer solves all of that. It handles everything, you just run it.

# Why should you use this tool?
It's far more efficient and powerful, it's currently in a BETA phase though and I aim to add more features in the future to it. However, it's still plenty powerful for now.

# Why isn't it working?
If it's not working then it's likely due to having the incorrect installation of Spotify. Make sure you have Spotify directly from Spotify themselves, not from anywhere else like the Microsoft Store for example. Try it again after that, it should work perfectly fine.
